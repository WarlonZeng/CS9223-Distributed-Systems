run instructions
where the Makefile is, run "make" on terminal
after that, run "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
you will need to run this for every new terminal (one for server, one for client)
./kvserver
./kvclient <your parameters>

Copy and Pasted for your convenience:
./kvclient -server host:port -set 'my_key' 'my_value'

./kvclient -server host:port -get 'my_key' > my_value_file

./kvclient -server host:port -get 'my_key' my_value_file

./kvclient -server host:port -del 'my_key'

i think for -get ">" the ">" is undetectable to me.
might have to run w/o ">". file is still outputed.
